## üéØ TESTING CHECKLIST

### Manual Testing (Before Recording Video)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
cd /Users/yousseftarek/Documents/iot-project/iot-project/src
python3 server.py

# Terminal 2: Start client (in separate window)
cd /Users/yousseftarek/Documents/iot-project/iot-project/src
python3 client.py

# Expected: See INIT followed by DATA messages in server terminal
# Expected: No errors, clean output
```

### Baseline Test Execution

```bash
cd /Users/yousseftarek/Documents/iot-project/iot-project/tests
./baseline_test.sh

# Expected output:
# - "Test Result: PASS"
# - Total packets: ~61
# - Success rate: ‚â•99%
```
